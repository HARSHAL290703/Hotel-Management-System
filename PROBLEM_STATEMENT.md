## HotelWise – Comprehensive Hotel Management System

HotelWise aims to revolutionize hotel operations by providing a complete digital solution for managing hotel rooms, bookings, guests, and operations through an integrated web-based platform. Traditional hotel management relies heavily on manual processes, paper-based records, and disconnected systems, leading to booking conflicts, inefficient room allocation, difficulty in tracking guest history, lack of real-time insights, and poor operational visibility. Additionally, hotel staff struggle with managing room availability, calculating revenue, tracking occupancy rates, and maintaining accurate guest records.

HotelWise addresses these challenges by providing a technology-driven solution that combines Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, RESTful API architecture, and modern web technologies to streamline hotel operations. The system offers the following key functionalities:

• **Room Management Module**: Hotel administrators can add, update, and delete rooms with different types (Single, Double, Suite) and manage room statuses (available, maintenance, cleaning). The system supports room search, filtering, and amenities management, ensuring efficient inventory control and room allocation.

• **Booking Management System**: Guests and staff can book rooms with automatic date validation, cost calculation, and confirmation number generation. The system handles check-in and check-out processes, booking modifications, and prevents double-booking conflicts through real-time availability checks.

• **Guest Management & Tracking**: The system maintains comprehensive guest profiles with contact information, booking history, and preferences. Administrators can view all guest records, track repeat customers, and access complete booking histories for better customer relationship management.

• **Analytics & Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard provides key performance indicators including total rooms, available rooms, booked rooms, revenue calculations, and occupancy rates. Visual progress indicators help hotel managers make data-driven decisions and optimize room utilization.

• **Notifications & Alerts System**: Automated notification system alerts staff about upcoming checkouts, rooms requiring maintenance, and important operational events. Priority-based alerts ensure timely action on critical tasks, improving guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.
